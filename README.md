# Web Skill Assessment

Welcome to the code challenge for Touchtribe. This repo is actually a small web
application, a video player written in React, and your job is to implement some
improvements and features.

There are several tasks listed below as **Required**, which are the baseline for
completing a successful application. There are more tasks listed as **Extra**,
which are either extra credit or which you may be asked by a hiring manager to
complete.

Feel free to reach out to your point of contact at Touchtribe with any
questions.

# General Setup and Submission Process

1. Fork this repo to your personal GitHub account.

2. Clone the forked repo to your computer and install its dependences with npm.

3. Create a branch with your name (e.g.: _jane-doe_) in your fork.

4. Complete the **Required** tasks (see below).

5. Complete any **Extra** tasks that you can within the given time.

6. Make a PR against the master branch from your name branch. **Do not PR across
   forks. PR against your fork's master!**

7. Alert your recruiter that you've submitted a PR. They _may_ ask you to add
   collaborators.

# Required Coding Tasks

1. Implement these layouts for mobile and desktop. Use Styled Components for the
   CSS.

Mobile

Desktop

2. Right now the app shows 3 videos, but there are more in video-data.json. Load
   these videos as well and implement scrolling in the VideoList component.

3. Sort the videos so they display alphabetically by title.

4. This is not a design challenge, but use your best judgement to make the site
   look nice.

5. Make the selected video autoplay when a tile in the list is clicked.

# Senior Role Requirements

The following additional tasks are required if you are applying for a senior
role.

1. Refactor the app to use Redux for managing global state. Make sure to enable
   Redux Dev Tools, too.

2. Write tests using the tool of your choice.

# Extra Tasks (Complete any you can in the given time.)

1. Consider doing any of the senior role requirements, if you haven't already.

2. Implement lazy loading, loading 5 videos at a time on scroll down in
   VideoList.

3. Add deep linking support so that a user can link directly to a video and so
   that clicking on a thumbnail not only plays the video but also reflects the
   title in the browser url bar. Consider a library like React Router.

4. Convert the app to TypeScript.

5. Write your own Express server that serves the app.
